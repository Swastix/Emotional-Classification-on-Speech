# Emotional-Classification-on-Speech
An end-to-end pipeline for classifying emotions from speech audio using data augmentation, handcrafted audio features (ZCR, RMSE, MFCC), and a 1D Convolutional Neural Network. The system achieves high accuracy and F1 scores across multiple emotion classes, and includes a Streamlit-based web application for real-time inference.
